        <h3>Development Pricing</h3>

        <p>Our basic pricing for support/consulting is simple and public. While you can request our assistance on an
            ad-hoc basis, we value building an ongoing relationship. Pricing is calculated based on actual time worked 
            in 1 minute blocks, charged at the agreed rate. Charged hours will never exceed the agreed amount without
            client authorisation.</p>

        <h3>Task Management</h3>
        
        <p>During the course of your development we will manage a task board where you can monitor the progress 
            of each of your requests.</p>
        
        <h3>Time Sheets</h3>
        
        <p>We take pride in productitivity and therefore at the end of each billing period we provide you with a 
            detailed summary of time spent for each of your requested tasks.</p>
        
        <h3>Outside Australia?</h3>
