        <h3>Hourly Rates</h3>

        <p>Our basic pricing for support/consulting is simple and public. While you can request our assistance on an
            ad-hoc basis, we value building an ongoing relationship. If you commit to a number of hours per month, we
            can resource appropriately and assist more effectively since we'll be in-the-know about your infrastructure
            already; and you will note that it's also cheaper.</p>

        <p>Pricing is calculated based on actual time worked in 1 minute blocks, charged at the amount agreed when
            payment was accepted. The charged hours will never exceed the amount without client authorisation.</p>

        <p>Emergency availability is charged at $200/hr for business hours, $300/hr for all other hours, and is not
            guaranteed for non-subscription clients.</p>

        <h3>Outside Australia?</h3>
        
        <p>GST will be added to the price during payment. If you are outside Australia please use one of the following coupons to remove the 10% GST:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>EXGST</code> - for consultation or development bookings.</li>
            <li><code>EXGSTP</code> - for development packages.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Terms &amp; Conditions</h3>
